            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a singer, producer, songwriter and performer from Oakland, CA. My music is a journey through which the listener gets to experience life from my perspective. I strive to capture emotion at its purest and let the listener see me at my most passionate and vulnerable. As a child my parents listened to a lot of jazz, soul and rock music. As a teenager I found myself obsessed with neo-soul, r&b and rap music. As a creator it is my mission to explore every genre I interact with, and use my strengths as a writer and performer to inject everything I do with every ounce of soul within my body.

                <p>The first project that WILLEM takes us through his highschool years. It details the adventures he had throughout San Francisco and his hometown of Oakland. Trying to escape his demons through drugs, girls and music.</p>

                <p>After <em>Days Without Consequence</em>. WILLEM takes year to experiment and develop new sounds. The Songs in the <em>Dilute My Vision</em> playlist exemplify this and give a hint of the genre-blending artist that he later develops into. The songs range in inspiration from Prince to Mac Demarco. The songs take a break from WILLEM's previously paniful lyrics and show a more passionate and cheerful side of his personality.</p>

                <p>
                Continuing his experimentation with indie rock, WILLEM writes existential lyrics about the state of the world and its affect on his relationships. The third track <em>Internal Dialect</em> is WILLEM showing his strengths as a musician and composer through writing a gentle yet creepy jazz balad.
